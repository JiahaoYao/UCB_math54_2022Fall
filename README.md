# Course Description

Sections will cover worksheets with relevant material from class. Here, you are encouraged to collaborate with your peers and ask questions for more hands-on learning of the material. Attendance is not mandatory, but is strongly encouraged for your own sake as a learner. 

I welcome any feedback you may have for how I can better support your learning needs. You can contact me by e-mail, office hours, or an anonymous feedback form (https://forms.gle/uayWduqNcohufm449). 

# Inclusivity Statement

Apart from the material covered, this course also aims to offer a meaningful and inclusive ex perience to every participant of this class. My hope is that throughout the course you feel challenged by the material while simultaneously feeling supported by your peers, including myself. Throughout the duration of this course please prepare to take on the role of both an active participant as well as an active listener and be patient with not only your own learning but your fellow classmates. If at any point you feel that any of the above goals are not being fulfilled in our learning environment, please do not hesitate to contact me and we can work together to remedy the problems. 

# Grading Policy

We will have weekly quizzes on Thursday starting in Week 2. Quizzes will be administered in the last 30 minutes of class and will cover material from the previous week. Quizzes will be closed-note, just like the midterm and final exams for the course. Late homework will not be accepted. Your two lowest quiz scores will automatically be dropped (including quizzes that you miss). 

# COVID/Illness Policy

Although no longer officially required, I ask that you wear a mask indoors per university recom mendations. If you feel ill, please do not come to class until you feel better. I am happy to make reasonable accommodations for students who miss class due to sickness. Currently, I plan to send out a copy of my notes to students who request them. Please contact me by email or in my office hours if questions arise! 

# Academic Integrity Policy 

You are expected to work on quizzes alone and without notes. You are welcome to (and encour aged to) work on problem sets with others, though you are expected to complete and submit your own copy of the assignment. If you do collaborate with others, it is expected that you document your collaborators at the start of the homework. 

# Disability Services for Students 

The purpose of academic accommodations is to ensure that all students have a fair chance at academic success and every attempt will be made to accommodate qualified students with disability. Students have the right to reasonable academic accommodations, without having to disclose personal information to instructors. For more information about accommodations, scheduling conflicts related to religious creed or extracurricular activities, please see the Academic Accommodations website (https://evcp.berkeley.edu/programs-resources/academic-accommodations-hubaccommodations). Note that services are confidential, may take time to put into place, and are not retroactive. After you have established accommodations with the DSP office, please email me personally so we can set up a meeting and make arrangements for how to best accommodate you throughout the course.
